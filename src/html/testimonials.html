              The team we interacted left a pleasant impression. We were discussing the details and received demo
              versions of the work. This approach made the best implementation of our idea in life. Hope for further
              cooperation.

              Fairly good company. They were able to complete the project in a timely manner despite of frequent changes in requirements.

              I’m not really sure how old I was when I got the gift for Christmas, but I remember
              thinking
              it
              was
              a pretty impressive piece of electronic hardware. It was really cool looking
              (technologically
              speaking), and I was awfully proud to own it.
